# MEDIA-ON-THE-FLY
This project was made for my company because they needed to reproduce and swap videos "on-the-fly".

The main objective is to play the video that the user select BUT if the video file is overwritten then the application must reproduce the new file without other user interactions.
Since the application is running in a multi-monitor environment, the user is able to choose the destination monitor for the player.
Also there are some other options:
- volume
- reproduce all files in a folder
- run the application at Windows startup

I liked the idea of the application so I made the repository public.

The project and the application are in Italian languge, maybe in the future I can translate it.
Not planning on constantly update the repo - open to suggestions/corrections.
